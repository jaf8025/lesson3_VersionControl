            </h2>
            <p class="lead">In SCM or VCS, a repository is an on-disk data structure which stores metadata for a set of files or a directory structure.  A digital repository is a mechanism for storing digital content.  There are two kinds of digital repositories: local and remote. The reason for a repository is to store a set of files including multiple iterations of the files and the history of changes made to those files. A local repository is stored on the machine that the user is working on.  It may be a cache of the copy from the remote download.  Remote repositories are versions are versions of a project or code that are hosted on the Internet or on remote machines somewhere on the cloud.</p>

            <p class="lead">GitHub is a commercial product that provides a web based Git.  It has 14 million users who maintain over 35 million repositories.  It is the largest repository of source codes in the world.  A Git is a version control system (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files and coordinating work on those files among multiple people. Gits are primarily used for software development.  They have the extraordinary capacity of allowing multiple persons to work on the same project, independently but at the same time.  They are uniquely constructed so that they can be used to keep track of changes in any files.</p> 

            <p class="lead">GitHUB is popularly known as a version control system (VCS) that operates as an Internet hosting service.  It offers a free platform version control system as well as a private for pay version.  User accounts on GitHub require registration to upload and store codes but there is also free access to the public for browsing the public repositories that are stored on its platform. Registered users can load, manage, discuss, review and submit contributions to repositories of others.  In addition to its Git services it provides access control, bug tracking, feature requests, task management and wikis for every project in its repositories.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Cloud9 is a privately owned commercial enterprise that provides an online integrated development environment (IDE).  It is published as open source.  It provides a free public platform as well as an advanced commercial version for pay subscribers.  Users need to create profiles to utilize the system.  Cloud9 is currently owned by Amazon.com and has operations in Seattle and Amsterdam.  An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development. An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Some of the IDEs have intelligent code completion.</p>  
            <p class="lead">The Cloud9 IDE permits software developers to enter their codes on pre-configured workspaces.  It facilitates integration with the numerous other code databases and platforms that permit the uploading of templates and formats into the system.  Cloud9 facilitates collaborate with their peers and cooperative coding features.  Items such as preview and browser compatibility make project review a breeze.   It supports code repositories such as GitHub and BitBucket with allows even higher levels of collaboration and review.  It has a built in terminal which uses Unix commands.  Cloud9 supports many programming languages including C, C++, php, JavaScript, Python, Perl, Ruby and Go.   </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">UNIX is an operating system for servers, desktops and laptops that was developed in the 1960s.  It has been under constant development ever since. As an operating system it consists of a suite of programs which make the computer work. It is a stable, multi-user, multi-tasking system for servers, desktops and laptops.</p>
            <p class="lead">The UNIX operating system is made up of three parts; the kernel, the shell and the programs.   The shell acts as an interactive command interpreter, it is really a programming language in which each statement runs a command.  A command-line interpreter permits a user to issue various commands in a very efficient way. However the user must know the names of the commands, their parameters and how the syntax of the language is interpreted.  Cloud9 has an integrated terminal which employs a Unix shell to communicate with GitHub.  It pushes our files to a remote repository.</p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A source control management system (SCM) is software that provides coordination and services between members of a software development team. Source Control Management is synonymous with Version Control, Source Contral and Version Control Systems (VCS).  One source stated that the term SCM is the term more popular with software engineers and JavaScript programmers and VCS is more often used by system administrators, in business and by laymen.  All SCM or VCS provide file manage and version control so that team members will not overwrite each otherâ€™s changes.  Only the newest versions of files are identified for use in the workspace.  The products also give developers the ability to work concurrently on files and enables them to merge their changes with the changes of others.  They are also able to track changes, audit them, fix the status of bugs and control releases.  </p>
